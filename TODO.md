# TODO ðŸš§

## Review structure

Begin by looking at the structure of the HTML. This is a basic example of nesting elements inside parent containers.
#### Discuss these questions:
1. What is the top-most parent container?
2. What happens to the elements as you stretch and shrink the window?
3. What is different about the div elements?

## The main container
1. Notice the main container begins with a hashtag. That is because it is an ID selector, only one can exist with this name.
```css
#main-container  {
  
  
}

```

2. Notice the other ones begin with a ``.``   This is because they are class selectors. You can have multiple ones and the CSS will affec them all.
3. Change the main container's width. Try to use both pixels and percentage. 

```css

#main-container  {
  
  width: 40%; /* will be a fixed size */
  
  
}

```
